  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port

  # using a specific IP.

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb, override|
    override.vm.box_url = "http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box"
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
  end

  config.vm.provider 'vmware_fusion' do |vm, override|
    override.vm.box_url = "http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64_vmware_fusion.box"
    vm.vmx['memsize'] = '1024'
  end

  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.


  # Enable provisioning with chef solo, specifying a cookbooks path, roles
  # path, and data_bags path (all relative to this Vagrantfile), and adding
  # some recipes and/or roles.
  #
